# Executive Dashboards
Executive Dashboards in this group are focused on high level comparisons over time (4 week and 12 week)
- Wherever possible Org level metrics are used for compatibility
- Included Terraform files expect a Splunk Observability token to be available in the `signalfx_auth_token` environment variable.
  - Env Var Example: `export TF_VAR_signalfx_auth_token=this-is-my-splunk-observability-token`
- If required you can input your own `api_url` variable for your Splunk Observability org
  - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk-terraform/signalfx/latest/docs  
    ```
    api_url - (Optional) The API URL to use for communicating with SignalFx. This is helpful for organizations that need to set their Realm or use a proxy. You can also set it using the SFX_API_URL environment variable.
    ```
- Log Events dashboards can be enriched with a Log Observer Metric noted below

**Reminder:** These dashboards can be edited to include more context or split by dimensions specific to your own concerns. 


## Log Observer Severity Metric
This metric enables visualizing log observer ingest by severity/log level.
```
Matching Condition: Match All

Operation: count

Dimensions: ["severity","deployment.environment"]
(Replace "deployment.environment" with your environment dimension)

Field: null

Metric Name: logs.events.count

```
