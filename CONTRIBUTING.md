# Contributing

Contributions are encouraged and greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs/Issues:

If you are reporting a bug or issues, please include:

-   Operating system name and version.
-   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful
    in troubleshooting (E.G. Python version if using a python script, Terraform version if you're using a Terraform script.).
-   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Check the Issues for this repo on GitHub. Anything tagged with
a "bug" ticket type is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

If you have a great set of dashboards, detectors, API scripts for sending metrics, or any other content 
you believe will be of use to others, please contribute it!

Or check the Issues for this repo on GitHub. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

Submissions and `README.md` files could always use more documentation. Documentation can always use an update or tweak in the official docs, in docstrings of scripts, comments in configs, or anywhere a bit of clarity may be useful..

### Submit Feedback

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain in detail how it would work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier
    to implement.
-   Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that
    contributions are welcome :)

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include a `README.md` for any new submission.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the `README.md` docs for that component or submission should be updated.
    Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add
    the feature to the list in README.md.
3.  Terraform submissions should work with the most current version of the included Terraform Provider.
4.  Python submissions should work for Python3
